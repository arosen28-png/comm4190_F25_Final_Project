    "# üí° Final Project: *CarePal ‚Äî An AI Companion for Family Caregivers*\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Project Concept\n",
    "CarePal is an LLM-based web application designed to support **family caregivers** who manage the day-to-day needs of loved ones ‚Äî such as elderly parents, children with special needs, or those recovering from medical procedures. The app combines natural conversation, organization tools, and empathetic guidance to make caregiving easier and less stressful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Goals\n",
    "- Provide **emotional support** and natural, empathetic chat interactions for caregivers.  \n",
    "- Help track **medications, appointments, and tasks** through conversational prompts.  \n",
    "- Generate **messages and summaries** (e.g., communicating with doctors or family members).  \n",
    "- Summarize **medical notes or care instructions** into clear, digestible language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## üßæ Pitch\n",
    "*CarePal* is an AI-powered assistant that helps family caregivers stay organized, informed, and emotionally supported. Using a large language model, CarePal tracks medications and appointments, drafts messages for coordinating care, and offers kind, context-aware responses to help users navigate stress and uncertainty. By blending emotional intelligence with practical utility, CarePal demonstrates how LLMs can act as **compassionate partners in everyday caregiving communication**.\n",
