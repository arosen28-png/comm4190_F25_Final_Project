    "\n",
    "CarePal is an AI-powered assistant designed to support family caregivers through conversation, guidance, and organization. Using a large language model, CarePal helps users track medications and appointments, generate polite messages for coordinating with doctors or family members, and provide empathetic emotional support through natural dialogue. It also offers quick, context-sensitive summaries of medical instructions or resources, helping caregivers save time and reduce stress. By blending emotional intelligence with practical utility, CarePal demonstrates how LLMs can serve as compassionate partners in everyday caregiving communication."
